# BlackJackBasic
Java project for BlackJack

This is my 1st Java project that I have created. It is a basic program for the playing card game BlackJack. This program does not deal with any Exceptions or consists any Threads. It assumes that the user input is always valid. I would be programming a better version of game which would allow players to place a bet and gain profits/loses. I would also be adding Exception Handling and better functioning of this project.
